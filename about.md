My name is Adrian. I'm a problem solver and info glutton, helping run a family and watching the future unfold from Houston, Texas. By day I'm the Director of Development at [UpTrending](http://www.uptrending.com/), leading the finest team of developers I've had the pleasure of working with.

I've been professionally active in web development for 15 years. Over that time I've been [mentioned in an O'Reilly book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596101619.do), lead teams on [Emmy](http://www.twondemand.com/) and [Webby](http://tv.adobe.com/) nominated work, had my photos published in [Resident Advisor](http://www.residentadvisor.net/) and appear in 0.1s of the Helvetica movie.

I collect hobbies, but the mainstays are photography, cycling, breaking things, and cooking. Topics that get my blood pumping: social progress, security/privacy, telepresence, vr, women in STEM, human-scale transportation, LBGTQI, the oxford comma, and the future of urbanism.
